    Horizontal Scaling of
    a Web3 system to the sky
    and beyond in AWS
  abstract: |
    [web3.storage](http://web3.storage) is a system living on top of [Interplanetary File System
    (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io) to provide non technical people access to a completely decentralized file sharing network
    designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge.

    The massive success of the initiative quickly brought the system to a point were it was not able to handle the
    growth. Uploaded files were only available for downloads after several days due to limited capacity. Adding new
    processing nodes took literally days due to the complex bootstrap procedures mandated by the different network
    protocols involved.

    In this talk I will show how we have been able to migrate to a new fully stateless system by carefully making
    assumption and leveraging AWS services. We developed a system that now can perform infinite horizontal scalability
    and it is able to consistently handle millions of uploads per day.
