  title: Don’t break GraphQL, extend it!
  abstract: |
    GraphQL is powerful technology to retrieve and send complex structures from remote locations with a simple and
    effective syntax. One of its perks is avoid under-fetching and over-fetching as the client specifically requests the
    fields it’s interested in. 

    But what happens if we need to enrich or customize the data set and we can’t modify the upstream GraphQL server?
    Shall we break the spec?

    In this talk I will show you how to use the resources the GraphQL specification already gives us to solve this issue
    without having to break the rules.
