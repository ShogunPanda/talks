  title: 'Reimagining Kafka for Node.js'
  abstract: |
    Kafka has become a go-to for powering real-time, event-driven apps.

    If you’re building with Node.js, dealing with Kafka hasn’t exactly been smooth sailing: the developer experience is not ideal and native libraries are not supporting all the new Node.js features like multithreading.

    So, we built something new. It’s fast, it’s built with TypeScript in mind, and it cuts through the mess to give you a clean, reliable way to work with Kafka in Node.js. Oh, and it’s 100% open source, as usual.

    In this talk, we’ll share the journey, show what it can do, and help you level up your Kafka game without the usual headaches.
