  title: 'Programming with a martial art principles'
  abstract: |
    In our daily studying effort, we all read article, blogs, books, watch video or attend conferences to learn
    something new about this bizarre industry we live in.

    But we are not only developers and we have a life far from our keyboards. If we bring our other passions and
    philosophies in our coding experience we reach a broad new set of possibilities.
