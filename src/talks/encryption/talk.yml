  - title: Why do we need end-to-end encryption?
    items:
      - icon: network
        title: Network communications are complicated
        text: In order to reach a peer on the other side of the world, many network devices and links are used. Each of these can be compromised.
      - icon: spy
        title: Wireless networks can be extremely insecure
        text: Misconfigured networks allow an attacker to listen to all the traffic.
      - icon: plug-connected
        title: LAN cables can be hacked
        text: |
          Anybody with physical access might replace a connector with a very small device.

  - title: Why is Caesar Cipher weak?
    content: Since only few permutations are possible, brute forcing is quite easy (especially if using letter frequency analysis).

    title: A good algorithm
    items:
      - icon: checks
        title: The algorithm **must** be public
        text: Public algorithms can be continously analyzed and validated from everyone.
      - icon: adjustments
        title: The security is in the parameters
        text: The parameters must be chosen so that brute forcing is unfeasible.

  - title: What are our choices today?
    content: The **Advanced Encryption Standard** (AES) is a secure symmetric block algorithm.
    image: '@talk/aes.webp'
  - title: Let's make the communication secure
    content:
      - Before starting encrypting the traffic, the peers have to choose a shared key. Shared key handshaking is not and cannot be encrypted.

    items:
      - icon: lock-access
        title: Brings security in the insecurity
        text: It allows to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel.
      - icon: abacus
        title: Strong mathematical basis
        text: It uses asymmetric keys to build a shared key.
      - icon: recycle
        title: It is fast and easy to implement
        text: Keys can (and should) be rotated in each message to improve security.
