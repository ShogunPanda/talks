    Maths or magic?
    End-to-end encryption
    explained with art
  abstract: |
    Every time we send a message on the most popular messaging platforms, we want to make sure that our communication is
    private and inaccessible to malicious users.

    We also want to ensure that in case of a data breach, the messages will be encrypted so that no one could
    potentially easily decrypt them. But how do we do that?

    How does end-to-end encryption work, and is it really that secure?

    In this interactive talk, we will see how to make our communications secure by implementing one of the most popular
    e2e encryption algorithms... with some help from the public!
