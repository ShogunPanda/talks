title: Why do we need end-to-end encryption?
items:
  entries:
    - icon: network-wired
      title: Network communications are complicated
      text: To reach a distant peer, many compromisable network devices and links are used.
    - icon: user-secret
      title: Wireless networks can be extremely insecure
      text: Misconfigured networks allow an attacker to listen to all the traffic.
    - icon: ethernet
      title: LAN connectors can be hacked

items:
  entries:
    - icon: user-check
      title: The algorithm **must** be public
      text: Public algorithms can be continously analyzed and validated from everyone.
    - icon: sliders
      title: The security is in the parameters
      text: The parameters must be chosen so that brute forcing is unfeasible.

  - The **Advanced Encryption Standard** (AES) is a secure symmetric block algorithm.

---
title: Let's make the communication secure
content:
  - Before starting encrypting the traffic, the peers have to choose a shared key.
  - Shared key handshaking is not and cannot be encrypted.
  - '*Anybody could steal the key.*'

items:
  entries:
    - icon: lock
      title: Brings security in the insecurity
      text: It allows to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel.
    - icon: calculator
      title: Strong mathematical basis
      text: It uses asymmetric keys to build a shared key.
    - icon: rotate
      title: It is fast and easy to implement
      text: Keys can (and should) be rotated in each message to improve security.
