    let's build a rendering service
  abstract: |
    Despite being 30 years old, QR codes have only recently started becoming widely used in mainstream applications,
    thanks to the availability of mobile phones and ease of implementation.

    Have you ever wondered how these codes work? How hard would it be to implement a rendering service?

    Bear with me on this amazing journey where I will show you how Platformatic makes it very easy to create a
    QR code rendering service in just a few minutes.
