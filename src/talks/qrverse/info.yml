  abstract: |
    Despite being 30 years old, QR codes have only recently started becoming widely used in mainstream applications,
    thanks to the availability of mobile phones and ease of implementation.

    In this talk, I will show you how Platformatic makes it very easy to create a QR code rendering 
    service in just a few minutes.
