    Compiling and bundling JS,
    the painless way
  abstract: |
    In the last years, the JavaScript ecosystem has grown exponentially.

    With it, many different compilers and build systems came to life to compete to reach the best possible performances,
    better stability, and compatibility with the language features.

    While five years ago, we had a few choices for compiling and bundling JavaScript (for either client or server),
    today, we have many good alternatives. ESBuild, SWC, Vite, WebPack... what are the differences between those tools?
    How do I choose the right one for my project?

    What can we predict about the future of the JavaScript ecosystem?
