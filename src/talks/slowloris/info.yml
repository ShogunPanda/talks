    The tale of avoiding a
    time-based DDOS attack
    in Node.js
  abstract: |
    Web applications are commonly vulnerable to several Distributed Denial of Service attacks, sometimes in unexpected
    ways. An example is the SlowLoris attack, an exploit that leads to service interruption by simply sending the data
    to the server as slowest as possible.

    In this talk I will tell the tale of how it took almost 13 years for Node to be completely protected by SlowLoris
    attack. I will also show that sometimes prioritizing performance can lead to incorrect fixes that can result in a
    false sense of protection.
