    Workshop:
    The bees are important:
    use SDKs wisely
  abstract: |
    It is a well-known fact that if bees go extinct, many things in the world (if not the world itself)
    would disappear.

    The same goes for third-party APIs (which, with a horrible pun, translates to bees in Italian).
    Most of the time vendors providea SDK for your language to interact with their API. While this
    speeds up productivity, it slows down performance and makes you dependent on SDK bugs or supply
    chain vulnerabilities, that are not always addressed at the speed you would expect. Moreover, you
    never deal with the API directly and this removes the pressure to vendors for a developer-first
    designed APIs.

    In this workshop, I will show how most of the time you don’t need an SDK since you can easily code
    everything you need by yourself using a simple HTTP call.
