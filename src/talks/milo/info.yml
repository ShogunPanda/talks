  title: Milo, a new HTTP parser for Node.js
  abstract: |
    Node.js HTTP parsing currently relies on llhttp, a parser which provides very good performance but has currently
    some challenges for the health of the runtime.

    Is it possible to create a modern, maintenable, well documented, secure and performant alternative? Yes it is!

    Let me introduce you Milo, a new Rust based HTTP parser which I plan to integrate into Node.js and let me show you
    how you can help be a part of its first Rust component.
