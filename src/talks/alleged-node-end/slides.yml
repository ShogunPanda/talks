title: Node.js core collaborators maintain the nodejs/node GitHub repository
content:
  - '*@nodejs/collaborators* have commit access to the nodejs/node repository and access to the Node.js continuous integration (CI) jobs.'
  - |
    Both collaborators and non-collaborators may propose changes to the Node.js source code.
    The mechanism to propose such a change is a GitHub pull request (PR).
  - Collaborators review and merge (<i>land</i>) pull requests.
# ---

---
title: The review process
content:
  - |
    Two collaborators must approve a pull request before the pull request can land.
    (<i>One collaborator approval is enough if the pull request has been open for more than 7 days.</i>)
  - |
    Approving a pull request indicates that the collaborator accepts responsibility for the change.
    Approval must be from collaborators who are not authors of the change.
  - |
    If a collaborator opposes a proposed change, then the change cannot land.
    **The exception is if the TSC votes to approve the change despite the opposition.**
  - |
    Involving the TSC is usually unnecessary: often, discussions or further changes **result in collaborators removing their opposition**.


# ---
---
title: The Node.js Technical Steering Committee
content: |
  The TSC voting members are responsible for all technical development within the Node.js project, including:

  - Setting release dates.
  - Release quality standards.
  - Technical direction.
  - Project governance and process.
  - GitHub repository hosting.
  - Conduct guidelines.
  - Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
  - Development process and any coding standards.
  - Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators or Foundation projects.


# ---
---
title: In case of disagreements, the TSC votes
content:
  - TSC members can be either regular members or voting members.
  - |
    Regular members can attend meetings and participate in TSC discussions, but do not vote.
    Voting members can do everything regular members can do, and also have the ability to cast votes when consensus is not reached on an issue.
  - TSC memberships are not time-limited and there is no maximum size of the TSC. The TSC must have at least four voting members.
  - '**No more than one-fourth of the TSC voting members may be affiliated with the same employer at any time.**'
