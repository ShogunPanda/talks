    The last 5 years of
    streams in Node.js
  abstract: |
    Thanks to a community of passionate contributors, Node.js is constantly evolving. Streams have been a core feature
    since the beginning but are still very much in active development.

    In this talk I will guide the audience through the changes that have been added in the last five years of Node.js
    development and how they impacted performance. Do you already know how to use them properly?

    Finally Iâ€™ll introduce readable-stream v4.0.0, a full refactor which brings all these changes to user-land,
    regardless of the Node.js version installed on the system.
