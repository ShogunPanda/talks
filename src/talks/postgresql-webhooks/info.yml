    How to create a PostgreSQL
    based webhook system
  abstract: |
    Webhooks are essential in modern API interactions, as they eliminate the need for polling-based 
    architectures and significantly improve latency in distributed workflows by providing 
    near-instantaneous responses to changes, enabling more efficient and real-time data 
    synchronization across systems.

    In this talk, I will demonstrate how to leverage PostgreSQL as a centralized message store for
    queuing and managing webhook events with transactional integrity. 
    Additionally, I will cover the implementation of a dead-letter queue (DLQ) to gracefully handle failures, 
    cron jobs for managing recurring events, and a leader election mechanism to enforce an exactly-once
    execution model, ensuring reliable and consistent event processing across distributed systems.
